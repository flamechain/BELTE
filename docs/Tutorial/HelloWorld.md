# Hello World Program

Once you have your main file, you can include `System.Stdio` to be able to print to stdout.

We will be using `Console.PrintLine` to print a single string.

<img src="..\img\helloworld.png" alt="belte" width="500" />

Next, you can use the Buckle compiler immediately run your program.

<img src="..\img\run_helloworld.png" alt="belte" width="350" />
