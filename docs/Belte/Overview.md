# 1 Overview

The Belte language is syntactically very similar to C#; Belte is a "C-Style" language that supports both object-oriented
and procedural paradigms.

Currently, the Belte compiler, Buckle, supports interpretation and transpilation to C#, with .NET build integration on
the way! You can read more about using the compiler [here](../Buckle.md).
