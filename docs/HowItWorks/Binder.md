# Binder

The binder is where the type checking and symbol resolving happens.

// talk about the challenge of nested/local functions, inline functions, $eval, main, scoping, resolving function
declarations before function bodies, type clauses, global statements, returns with cfg, variable declarations with
initializer lists, null, calling with named and optional parameters, break and continue stack, implicit typing
(especially with initializer lists and inline function returns), assignment (reference and constant checking)
