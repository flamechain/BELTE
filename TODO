TODO

  Standard
    * Implement TypeBase
    * add interfaces to all types
    * Add docstrings to InterfaceBase & TypeBase & System Libraries
    * Add base inherited interfaces to base types
    * rethink a lot of things like extension methods, callbacks, optimization methods
      STD vs Standard vs . vs System vs BELTE vs Common vs Default?

  Buckle
    * Add file exists checking for input files
    * update strap to match C# Silver impl OOP
    * setup azure pipeline for testing builds?
    * fix naming to be consistent (probably lower camel-case for vars)

  Extension
    * String interpolation regex
    * all inherited classes with highlighting not just first one
    * preprocessor constant regex (intellisense)
    * fix doxygen comment regex to highlight
    * type followed by () use function highlighting (for basic type declarations)
    * intellisense for extension
    * fix extension example image
    * add yellow highlighting to <name>.<something> name if enum, remove if not
    * make class constructors not look like functions (intellisense probably)
    * word counterparts to logical operators?
    * `decimal<decimal Min=null, decimal<Min,> Max=null>` second Min and Max should be template param, but currently show as vars
    * const and static members same as preproc constants?

  Docs
    * finish all docs

  Belte & Formatting
    * extension method syntax
        * if C# style: make typename after `this` not be parameter
    * <,0> and <0,> syntax acceptable? it is nice to use, but less consistent
        should avoid as much of making there multiple ways to do things, causes conflict when new people join team

  Other
    * make installer
    * trello board

Outside Ideas:

    * reflection .net, typeof, nameof
    * decorators
    * switch over any built-in data type
    * enum have multiple fields
    * ability to add enum entries at code-time (need to make it not happen at runtime somehow)
    * python style unpacking
    * parsimony
    * factory pattern
    * graphical instead of text file
