## Belte?

Belte is the **idea of a better language**, so while the Buckle compiler is being developed in hopes of bringing
some of Belte's features to fruition, it is unlikely that Belte will ever be implemented in its totality.

To give a brief idea: Belte is a programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented paradigms that
aims to match the sleekness of C# and the power of C++ while still being easy to learn and use effectively.

More information about the design principles and language specification for Belte can be read
[here](docs/README.md).

## Using the Buckle Compiler

Buckle is the open-source implementation of the Belte compiler.

> Belte does not currently have a stable release, so expect bugs if you clone

Instructions on how to use the Buckle command-line utility to run Belte code can be viewed [here](docs/Buckle.md).

## Documentation

The docs can be browsed on the [GitHub Pages site](https://ryanwilsond.github.io/belte/) or
[locally in the repository](docs/README.md).

___

## Samples

There are multiple code samples in the `samples/` folder to show what the language is capable of in its current state.

More information about the samples is [here](samples/README.md).

Immo Landwerth's [Building a Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y)
series is really good for learning the basics of compiler implementation.

[Roslyn on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) is another really good place to learn about the implementation of a
compiler.
