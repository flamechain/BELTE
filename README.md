Buckle is the open-source implementation of the Belte compiler.

> **Belte is under development** and does not support all the features highlighted in [Principles.md](docs/Principles.md) \
> Belte does not currently have a stable release, so expect bugs if you clone

Belte is an object-oriented programming language aiming to have the same feel and power of C# and C++, while still being
very easy to learn and use effectively. [Here](docs/Principles.md) you can read about the goals and design principles of
Belte.

Immo Landwerth's [Building a Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y)
series is really good for learning the basics of compiler implementation.

[Roslyn on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) is another really good place to learn about the implementation of a
compiler.
