Buckle is the open-source implementation of the Belte compiler.

> **Belte is under development** and does not support all the features highlighted in [Principles.md](docs/Principles.md) \
> Belte does not currently have a stable release, so expect bugs if you clone

Belte is an object-oriented programming language aiming to have the same feel and power of C# and C++, while still being
very easy to learn and use effectively.

## Samples

There are multiple code samples in the `samples/` folder to show what the language is capable of in its current state.

More information about the samples is [here](samples/README.md).

## Documentation

To know what makes Belte unique from other languages, read [Principles.md](docs/Principles.md).

If you are wanting to look around the repo, consider taking a look at the [directory contents](DIRECTORY_CONTENTS.md).

The docs and full language reference can be found on the [GitHub Pages site](https://ryanwilsond.github.io/belte/).
Alternatively, you can directly view the docs [here](docs/index.md).

series is really good for learning the basics of compiler implementation.

[Roslyn on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) is another really good place to learn about the implementation of a
compiler.
